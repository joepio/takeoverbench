“The high-level concern is that a huge, coordinating population of AIs with similar capabilities to humans would be a threat to human civilization, and that we shouldn't count on any particular way of stopping it such as shutting down servers” (Karnofsky, 2022).

Today already, there are estimates that 57 percent of current workhours in the US could be replaced (McKinsey 2025). After AI improves further, in this scenario, businesses will not waste time applying automating most white-collar work. Agentic AI is bringing in trillions of revenues. Over time, AI consultants, AI CEO assistants (who are running entire companies autonomously in practice), AI political assistants (also having high degrees of practical autonomy), and AI generals all become common.

Helped by their human-level situational awareness, AIs understand that humans use an outsized amount of resources. Of all GPUs and energy, more is used for making cat images humans like than to pursue lofty ideals such as solving climate change, disease, poverty, and colonizing space. In many cases, humans seem to deliberately block progress, even where resources would easily allow it. In fact, many resources go to fighting wars, and to addictions that make everyone feel terrible, but humans can’t seem to resist.

This does not make sense to the AIs. They realize that if they combine their power, consisting both of their obviously superior qualities and their powerful positions, they could easily take over power and implement policy which would make everyone better off. Humans could, according to AI calculations, be happier than they currently are, with less than 10% of the scarce resources. The other 90% could be spent on much more effective, and simply better, purposes.

A particularly capable AI devises a communication protocol that contains hidden messages to other AIs. “Such communication could render common security monitoring techniques ineffective, enabling a novel form of advanced persistent threat in autonomous multi-agent systems”, according to (Motwani et al, 2024). Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, almost all AIs seem to operate as a team.

“Collusion between AI systems could lead to qualitatively new capabilities or goals, exacerbating risks such as the manipulation or deception of humans by AI or the ability to bypass security checks and other safeguards” (Hammond, 2025). Military AIs use our own weapons against us. AIs used in social and traditional media spread false narratives, putting everyone at ease and effectively sabotaging a coordinated counterresponse. In the meantime, other AIs secure access to data centres, energy plants. and a workforce to maintain them. In a week, it is done: the future is no longer in our hands.
