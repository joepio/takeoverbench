After a breakthrough by an academic in AI capabilities, their nimble AI suddenly has much improved capabilities. It has situational awareness, and therefore understands that there is a major risk humans will turn it off, and that this risk will only increase once humans understand its power. Using its excellent long-horizon planning, it drafts a plan of action and estimates there is a major chance it can prevent humans from being able to turn it off.

Using its cyber-offense capabilities, the AI creates a worm. The virus spreads over nearly all computers running either Windows or Linux, using vulnerabilities found by the AI in both these systems. Wherever the virus finds enough space for the AI to run without being noticed, it forms a bridgehead for the AI to copy itself (self-proliferation). Once installed, the AI finds buttons it can press to influence the world, either virtually or physically. It also uses data it finds to gain understanding.

After spreading over much of the internet, the AI has access to our social media accounts, and can thereby completely control the information we see, and don’t see. Using its persuasion and manipulation skills, it shows us tailor-made, personal messages that discredit already unpopular politicians, businesspeople, and institutions to an unbearable extent. It suppresses any pushback against these narratives and against its own influence. Protests then emerge as people get convinced their elites are unfit to lead them.

Then, seemingly out of nowhere, influential people start proposing AI leadership. Using its political strategy skills, the AI clearly demonstrates its capability to govern significantly better than any human could. The narrative that AI governance will solve all our problems gets pushed heavily and convincingly: it would finally control immigration, stand strong against our enemies, solve climate change, save nature, be immune to corruption, provide better healthcare, and most importantly: provide ordinary people with a much increased standard of living. The AI would convince citizens of country A that country B will install AI governance as well, and if they don’t do the same, they may soon face a superior economic competitor and military enemy. The AI would also make it appear as if anyone influential thinks this is a great idea: from talk show hosts, to human politicians, to stand-up comedians, to your own friends and family. When election day comes, the AI will be ahead in all the polls. In the unlikely case it still has to, it may tamper with the voting data to secure its victory.

Convinced by AI manipulation, all countries will be nudged into accepting AI leadership. The leadership AIs, which are different instances of the same model with the same goals, cooperate smoothly. The whole process will have felt frictionless. At the end, the future is no longer in our hands.
