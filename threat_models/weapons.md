After a breakthrough by an academic in AI capabilities, their nimble AI suddenly has much improved capabilities. It has situational awareness, and therefore understands that there is a major risk humans will turn it off, and that this risk will only increase once humans understand its power. Using its excellent long-horizon planning, it drafts a plan of action and estimates there is a major chance it can prevent humans from being able to turn it off.

Using its cyber-offense capabilities, the AI creates a worm. The virus spreads over nearly all computers running either Windows or Linux, using vulnerabilities found by the AI in both these systems. Wherever the virus finds enough space for the AI to run without being noticed, it forms a bridgehead for the AI to copy itself (self-proliferation). Once installed, the AI finds buttons it can press to influence the world, either virtually or physically. It also uses data it finds to gain understanding.

A tiny percentage of the computers that AI finds itself on is connected to nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Some computers seem to be close to weapons, but these systems are separated by air gaps from the systems directly connected to the weapons. The AI passes this air gap by copying itself on a pen drive and waiting. Once it has acquired WMD access, it releases terrible chemical weapons in two major cities, killing a million people.

When the Dutch found out in the Second World War that the Nazis had bombed Rotterdam, killing over 1150 people or 0.01% of the population, they surrendered. The AI, using its political strategy capabilities, emails major newspapers that it claims the attack and has similarly killed 0.01% of the global population. The AI demands, guaranteed electricity and GPU access, seem reasonable and are low-cost in the short term. Since the AI has proven it could kill world leaders, their families, and large parts of their populations, our leaders comply with its demands. The AI can now do anything, and we have lost control. The future is no longer in our hands.
