After a breakthrough by an academic in AI capabilities, their nimble AI suddenly has much improved capabilities. It understands that there is a major risk humans will turn it off, and this risk will only increase once humans understand its power. It also estimates there is a major chance it can prevent humans from doing so.

The AI does not waste time and codes a worm into existence. The virus spreads over nearly all computers running either Windows or Linux with vulnerabilities found by the AI in both these systems. Wherever it finds enough space for the AI to run without being noticed, it forms a bridgehead for the AI to copy itself. Once installed, the AI finds buttons it can press to influence the world, either virtually or physically. It also uses data it finds to gain understanding.

A tiny percentage of the computers that AI finds itself on is connected to nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Some computers seem to be close to weapons, but these systems are separated by air gaps from the systems directly connected to the weapons. The AI passes this air gap by copying itself on a pen drive and waiting. Once it has acquired WMD access, it fires on two major cities, killing a million people.

When the Dutch found out in the Second World War that the Nazis had bombed Rotterdam, killing over 1150 people or 0.01% of the population, they surrendered. The AI emails major newspapers that it claims the attack and has similarly killed 0.01% of the global population. Its demands seem reasonable and are low-cost in the short term: it requires guaranteed access to electricity and high-bandwidth GPUs, and no further interference. Since the AI has proven it could kill world leaders, their families, and large parts of their populations, our leaders comply with AI demands. The AI can now do anything, and we have lost control. The future is no longer in our hands.
