# TakeOverBench

A combiend-benchmark for AI capabilites.
Compares how combinations of AI capabilities may lead to specific risks (threat models) and shows benchmark results in a clear and concise manner.

## Pages

- Home: Starts with one big chart, showing all benchmarks. Then shortly shows each threat model, in a smaller chart. If user clicks on the threat model, the next page opens:
- Threat Model: Shows a detailed description of the threat model, including its definition, impact, and mitigation strategies.
- About: Explains why we need this project. If AI capabilities keep increasing, at some point these systems may be able to run autonomously, spread themselves across the web, infiltrate our institutions and take over control from humans.
